## Simpliciter
Simpliciter has 3 modes: 
* SLICE SEQUENCER (the display allows to select a slice of the sample; all the CV operation are addressed to the current slice)
* SLICE GRID (the selection is fixed and precomputed and it can't be changed)
* PEAK SLICE GRID (the selection is fixed and precomputed and it can't be changed)

When GRID MODE is OFF, the substate PEAK GRID MODE is off too and Simpliciter is in SLICE SEQUENCER mode. The current slice is the one in memory and is always the one you are editing. You can save the current slice in the sequencer, edit another slice and do all the plays you want with CV inputs and after RELOAD it or maybe you want to update current register with current edit
